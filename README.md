# ICP Onboarding Hub BR

A community-driven initiative to onboard Brazilian developers and creators into the Internet Computer (ICP) ecosystem.

## 🔍 Problem

Many talented developers in Brazil lack access to localized content and support to enter Web3. This project addresses that by offering community engagement, tutorials, events, and online visibility focused on the Brazilian Web3 space.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong local presence for ICP through onboarding activities, educational content, and strategic communication.

## 📋 Plan

- Social media campaigns explaining ICP in Portuguese
- YouTube or Instagram Reels with ICP concepts
- Meetups or online talks with university devs
## 🗺️ Roadmap – ICP Ambassador Actions (Brazil)

### 1. Onboarding & Education
- Create short-form videos explaining what ICP is (in Portuguese)
- Post an educational series on LinkedIn and Instagram
- Build a quick-start guide for beginners: “Getting Started with ICP” (PDF or Notion format)

### 2. Community Engagement
- Connect the project with local university groups (IEEE, student clubs, etc.)
- Organize online sessions or intro talks (live or via Discord)
- Stay active in ICP channels and share updates with the Brazilian community

### 3. Technical Content & Missions
- Write beginner-friendly tutorials (Markdown or video) showing how to use ICP
- Share local use cases and Web3 opportunities in Brazil
- Translate key technical docs into Portuguese to improve access

### 4. Expansion & Networking
- Invite other Brazilian devs and creators to explore the ICP ecosystem
- Encourage local participation in upcoming ICP hackathons
- Help structure a regional hub of ambassadors (e.g., Northeast, Central-West, etc.)

🎯 The goal is to make ICP more accessible, visible, and active in Brazil — especially for students, entry-level developers, and Web3 content creators.
