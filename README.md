# ICP Onboarding Hub BR

A community-driven initiative to onboard Brazilian developers and creators into the Internet Computer (ICP) ecosystem.

## 🔍 Problem

Many talented developers in Brazil lack access to localized content and support to enter Web3. This project addresses that by offering community engagement, tutorials, events, and online visibility focused on the Brazilian Web3 space.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong local presence for ICP through onboarding activities, educational content, and strategic communication.

## 📋 Plan

- Social media campaigns explaining ICP in Portuguese
- YouTube or Instagram Reels with ICP concepts
- Meetups or online talks with university devs
